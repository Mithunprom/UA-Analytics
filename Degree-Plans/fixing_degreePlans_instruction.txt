The goal is to make sure the degree type, CIP code, course name, course prefix and course number are correctly entered

Instructions,
1. Fix Degree Type, also change the Degree type in the file name

2. Enter CIP code

3. Fix Course name Go to https://www.arizona.edu/degree-search/majors?cat-location=main-tucson
	fill the course name, and double check if the course name is correct, fix it if not
	some examples, 
	course name: A or C EMS Leadership, 
	it supposes to be course name: Leadership prefix/num: EMS 493A or EMS 493C (the original text is EMD 493 A or C EMS Leadership)
	if you have to choose between multiple courses("or" in between courses), just choose the first one

4. Don't worry about ISSUE_FILE for now, we may need to go to department's websites to find out

5, If a course name doesn't contain Elective/Second Language/Tier .../, and prefix and number are empty, and
	if that name occurs in the course.csv as a course name, enter the prefix and number(from the course.csv) into the degree plan file.
	you may want to search by keywords since the name may not have an exact match

6. Don't worry about college of science and college of engineering since they are done already


File structures,
Folder names are college names, 
	files in each folder are programs offered by that college, and their files names are the program name shown in the website above


course.csv is included in the folder, or you can file course.csv here,
https://github.com/heileman/UA-Analytics/blob/master/Courses-Scrape/course.csv

If some files are too strange, make notes and put them aside, and we can fix them all together after.

I suggest you can put the fixed degree plans into separate folders so that you can track the progress.
